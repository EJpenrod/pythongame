This text based game was created by Ezekiel Penrod

this was my first python project and first time ever touching python in general

there was alot learned in the game, such as looping, stepping into other functions carrying over information from previous functions. using list and dictionaries, storing stats and creating monsters on the fly, and basically letting RNG take the wheel the whole time. 

Honestly my favorite thing was just adding the ascii art. fighting a slime is cool but seeing a slime that you are fighting is even better.

If im being honest, coding the game was more fun then actually playing the game. the challenge in itself of making something was a lot more fun then i thought it would be. When you are creating something imagination and know how are pretty much the only things holding you back and thats a great feeling. 

admittedly the game isnt complete but the early game loop is fun enough to try out a few different classes mostly just to read my ramblings of how your class was created


--- this game consist of leveling up, fighting monsters, unlocking loops to fight previous monsters. the end game goal is to defeat the dragon, maybe two, three of them if RNG really doesnt like you. inorder to fight them though you gotta fight your way there. 

there is a town function to heal, there was going to be a shop and a crafting mini game of sorts but it got put on hold

the town board once past a certain mob will let you loop all previously encountered monsters for the sweet sweet exp---
