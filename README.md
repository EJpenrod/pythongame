This text based game was created by Ezekiel Penrod

this was my first python project and first time ever touching python in general

there was alot learned in the game, such as looping, stepping into other functions carrying over information from previous functions. using list and dictionaries, storing stats and creating monsters on the fly, and basically letting RNG take the wheel the whole time. 

Honestly my favorite thing was just adding the ascii art. fighting a slime is cool but seeing a slime that you are fighting is even better. 

admittedly the game isnt complete but the early game loop is fun enough to try out a few different classes mostly just to read the my ramblings of how your class was created
